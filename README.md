# AIO - Double Tap Run

This mod adds a double-tap-to-run feature to Minetest, enhancing gameplay by providing a seamless way to toggle between walking and running. Whether you're exploring vast terrains or escaping danger, this mod ensures smooth and intuitive movement control.

## Features

- **Double-Tap Forward to Run**: Activate running mode by quickly double-tapping the forward movement key (`W`).
- **Automatic Integration with Stamina Mods**: If supported stamina mods (e.g., Sofar's or Tenplus1's stamina mods) are installed, the mod will automatically adjust sprinting behavior based on stamina levels.
- **Liquid Interaction**: Automatically disables sprinting when the player is in liquid, ensuring realistic movement.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with Minetest without impacting performance.

## How to Use

1. **Double-Tap to Sprint**: Quickly press the forward movement key (`W`) twice to activate sprinting mode. Sprinting will increase your movement speed.
2. **Stop Sprinting**:
   - Release the forward key (`W`) to stop sprinting.
   - Press the auxiliary key (`E` or `Shift`, depending on your configuration) to cancel sprinting manually.
3. **Stamina Integration**:
   - If a supported stamina mod is installed, sprinting will automatically stop when your stamina falls below the threshold.
   - Stamina will drain while sprinting and regenerate when walking or standing still.
4. **Liquid Behavior**: Sprinting is automatically disabled when you enter liquid (e.g., water or lava), and your movement speed will return to normal.

Enjoy the enhanced movement mechanics with this mod!
